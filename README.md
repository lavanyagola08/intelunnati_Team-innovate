# intelunnati_team-innovate
The team innovate has done a project on road object detection using deep learning.
This is Pothole detection from real time video stream or images with Python.
We have used YOLOv4,the object detection algorithm and OpenCV library.
Data set used:-COCO(Common Objects in Context).
# Road Object Detection using Deep Learning

This project implements a road object detection system using deep learning techniques. It leverages the YOLOv4 algorithm integrated with OpenCV for accurate and efficient object detection on the road. The system is designed to detect various objects such as vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signs in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time object detection on road scenes.
- Integration of the YOLOv4 model with the OpenCV library for computer vision capabilities.
- Efficient handling of video frames or images for seamless detection.
- Robust performance in different road scenarios, including challenging lighting conditions and complex environments.
- Saving of detected object coordinates and images for further analysis.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/road-object-detection.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Place the YOLOv4 model files (weights and configuration) in the appropriate location within the project directory.

2. Run the script:
   ```
   camera_video.py
   ```
