The YOLOv4 model in this project was trained on the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset. COCO is a widely-used benchmark dataset for object detection, containing a diverse collection of images with annotated object bounding boxes and class labels. It encompasses a wide range of object categories, including vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signs, making it suitable for road object detection tasks.

To train the YOLOv4 model, the COCO dataset was used in conjunction with various data augmentation techniques. Mosaic data augmentation, a technique that combines multiple images into a single training example, was applied to enhance the model's ability to handle complex road scenes. Additionally, the CIOU (Complete Intersection over Union) loss function was utilized to optimize the model's performance during training.

It is worth noting that to reproduce the results and utilize the trained model, the COCO dataset or a subset of it should be obtained and properly formatted for training. Detailed instructions and scripts for dataset preparation can be found in the project's documentation.

Providing relevant information about the dataset used and any data preprocessing or augmentation techniques applied in the project's data section will help users understand the context and requirements for utilizing the code and reproducing the results.
